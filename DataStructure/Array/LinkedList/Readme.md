## Linked List
# üìò Best Linked List Topics and Problems for DSA in C

A curated guide for mastering linked lists in C while preparing for Data Structures & Algorithms. This README combines essential concepts, categorized problems, and links to practical exercises from sources like GeeksforGeeks and W3Resource.

## üß© Foundational Concepts

### **Types of Linked Lists**
- [Singly Linked List](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list): Each node contains `data` and a pointer to the next node.
- [Doubly Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/doubly-linked-list-in-c/): Each node has links to both previous and next nodes.
- [Circular Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/circular-linked-list/): The last node points back to the head.

### **Basic Operations to Master**
- Traversal
- Insertion (beginning, end, specific position)
- Deletion (beginning, end, specific position)
- Searching
- Counting nodes
- Reversing a list

## üîÅ Critical Algorithms

### **Two-Pointer Technique**
- Finding middle node
- Detecting cycle
- Removing nth node from end

### **Floyd‚Äôs Cycle-Finding Algorithm**
- Detects loops with fast and slow pointers.
- Time: `O(n)`  |  Space: `O(1)`

### **Recursion Techniques**
Used in traversal, reversal, and counting nodes.

### **Merge Sort for Linked Lists**
- Divide via slow/fast pointers
- Recursively sort halves
- Merge sorted parts

***

## üßÆ Memory Management in C

Use dynamic memory safely:

```c
struct Node* createNode(int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    return newNode;
}
```
Ensure proper deallocation with:

```c
free(nodePointer);
```

## ‚ö° Advanced Structures

- **Doubly Linked List:** browser history, undo-redo systems
- **Circular Linked List:** round-robin scheduling, multiplayer rotation
- **XOR Linked List:** space-efficient storage (stores XOR of next and previous)
- **Skip List:** O(log n) insertion, deletion, and search

## üîç Interview Preparation Strategy

### **Core Topics**
- Difference between arrays and linked lists
- Advantages of each type
