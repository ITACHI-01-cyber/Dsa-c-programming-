😀️🔹 1. INTRODUCTORY PROBLEMS (POINTER BASICS)

These are to get comfortable with pointer syntax, addresses, and dereferencing.

Print the address of a variable using a pointer.

Swap two numbers using pointers.

Find the length of a string using pointers (no strlen).

Copy one string into another using pointers.

Reverse a string using pointers.

Count vowels, consonants, digits in a string using pointers.

Implement your own strcpy, strcmp, strcat using pointers.

Dynamic memory allocation: take an array input using malloc/calloc and print it.

😀️🔹 2. BASIC PROBLEMS (POINTER ARITHMETIC & ARRAYS)

Now you use pointers for arrays and simple manipulations.

Access array elements using pointers (no indexing).

Find the largest and smallest element in an array using pointers.

Reverse an array using pointers.

Rotate an array left/right using pointers.

Implement bubble sort using only pointers (no arr[i] notation).

Implement binary search using pointers.

Find second largest element in an array using pointers.

Merge two arrays using pointers.

😀️🔹 3. INTERMEDIATE PROBLEMS (FUNCTION POINTERS & 2D ARRAYS)

Once you are comfortable, move to multidimensional arrays and function pointers.

Implement a matrix addition/multiplication using pointers.

Transpose of a matrix using pointers.

Write a function that accepts a function pointer for arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

Implement a callback function using function pointers.

Dynamic memory allocation for a 2D array using pointers.

😀️🔹 4. ADVANCED PROBLEMS (POINTERS + DATA STRUCTURES)

Here you combine pointers + data structures.

Implement a singly linked list (insert, delete, traverse).

Implement a doubly linked list.

Implement a circular linked list.

Implement a stack using linked list.

Implement a queue using linked list.

Implement a binary tree (insertion + traversal using recursion and without recursion).

Implement a binary search tree (BST) (insert, search, delete).

Implement a graph using adjacency list (pointer to linked list).

Implement hash table with chaining using pointers + linked list.

😀️🔹 5. EXPERT CHALLENGES (POINTER MASTERY)

These test your deep understanding.

Implement your own malloc() and free() (simple memory manager).

Implement a Trie (prefix tree) using pointers.

Implement a priority queue / heap using pointer-based binary tree.

Implement a graph traversal (DFS, BFS) using adjacency list with pointers.

Solve Josephus Problem using circular linked list and pointers.

Implement a LRU Cache using doubly linked list + hash map.

Serialize and deserialize a binary tree using pointers.
